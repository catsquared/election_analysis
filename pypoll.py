# In this project, our final Python script will need to be able to deliver
# the following information when the script is run: 


# Need to get the total number of rows? Or can just cycle through the data one by one
# Check if the Ballot ID id has duplicates?

# Use Python's built in module called csv

# Name the file to load
# file_to_load = "Resources/election_results.csv"

# Declare a file to write to

# Declare a file object
# election_data = open(file_to_load, 'r')

#   Equals total rows
#   Can count while the next row is not empty
# Every time the .py file is run, total votes should be 0

# Store information in a dictionary, or a list of dictionaries:
# {Candidate_name: Candidate_votes}



# Or Store information as
# ({Candidate_name: Name, No_of_Votes: Votes})

# A complete list of candidates who received votes
#   If the Candidate name is not in a list of Candidates already, add the Candidate name to the list
#   
# Total number of votes each candidate received
#   For each ballot ID, add 1 to the count for that candidate
#
# Percentage of votes each candidate won
#   For each candidate, calculate total votes he/she received divided by total ballots
#
# The winner of the election based on popular vote
#   The Candidate with the highest percentage of votes wins



# Close the file object after analysis is complete
# election_data.close()

# Close the file where analysis is performed
# outfile.close()
